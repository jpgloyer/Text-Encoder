I am writing this to test my encryption program.

Really, it is a very simple program. It changes the letter at each position by the value of their position modulod by 61.

Punctuation and any symbols other than a-z, A-Z, and 0-9 with appear just as they are. Messages will still difficult to read without the key, 
but this program isn't practical right now, however, I believe it was actually more difficult to limit this program to these constraints rather than
just using Unicode character value integers and allowing very very strange output to occur if using an incorrect key. This will be my 
next project.

The key is another drawback. Right now it's realilistically limited to 0-61. Any larger numbers will be converted to a number in that range. 
I would like to figure out how to make a string password work, but that's a project for another day.

Anyway, thanks for using my program!
